# IBM_DATA_SCIENCE_CAPSTONE
Applied Data Science Capstone
This capstone project represents the final (10th) course in the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate specialization. It serves as a comprehensive application of the skills and knowledge acquired throughout the program, bringing together all the learned concepts into a real-world data science project.

ðŸ“„ Project Overview
SpaceX has emerged as a leader in the commercial space industry by significantly reducing the cost of space travel. One of the key contributors to this cost reduction is the reusability of the Falcon 9 rocketâ€™s first stage. While SpaceX charges approximately $62 million per launch, other companies may charge over $165 million. Predicting the successful landing of the first stage is crucial, as it directly impacts the launch cost.

This project leverages public data and machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of SpaceX reusing the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket.

ðŸ“„ Research Questions
1. How do factors like payload mass, launch site, flight number, and orbit type influence the success of the first stage landing?

2. Has the rate of successful landings improved over the years?

3. What is the most effective algorithm for binary classification in this context?
